# Preppin' Data with dbt

## About
### What Is Preppin' Data?
[Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) is a fun weekly data prep challenge designed to grow your data prep skills. Challenges are presented ever Wednesday and solutions via [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) are released the following Tuesday. Participants are encouraged to use any data tool of their choice

### Why dbt? And what is this project?
preppin-data-dbt attempts to create an easy to use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project using VS Code devcontainers and [dbt-duckdb adapter](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb) to lower the barrier to entry of learning dbt as well as share my own code out in the open for others to learn from.
