## About
### What Is Preppin' Data?
[Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) is a fun weekly data prep challenge designed to grow your data prep skills. Challenges are presented ever Wednesday and solutions via [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) are released the following Tuesday. Participants are encouraged to use any data prep tool of their choice and tweet their solution using [#PreppinData](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PreppinData?src=hashtag_click).

### Why dbt? And what is this project?
preppin-data-dbt attempts to create an easy to use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project using VS Code devcontainers and [dbt-duckdb adapter](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb) to lower the barrier to entry of learning dbt as well as share my own code out in the open for others to learn from.

## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Download & Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- Improved [dbt docs Overview](https://jharris126.github.io/preppin-data-dbt/#!/overview) that emphasize
how to use the docs to explore solutions and why dbt is a great tool for Preppin' Data Challenges.
