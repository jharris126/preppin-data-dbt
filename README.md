## About
### What Is Preppin' Data?
[Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) is a fun weekly data prep challenge designed to grow your data prep skills. Challenges are presented ever Wednesday and solutions via [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) are released the following Tuesday. Participants are encouraged to use any data prep tool of their choice and tweet their solution using [#PreppinData](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PreppinData?src=hashtag_click).

### Why dbt? And what is this project?
preppin-data-dbt attempts to create an easy to use [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project using VS Code devcontainers and [dbt-duckdb adapter](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb) to lower the barrier to entry of learning dbt as well as share my own code out in the open for others to learn from.

## Getting Started
### Running and Exploring This Project

#### ***Running With GitHub Codespaces***
1. *Fork this repo* <br/> Create a fork of this repo and navigate to your fork

### Adding Your Own Solutions & Documentation
- ***Customizing Docs*** <br/> Most documentation in this repo is applicable to all, however, some are hard coded to my own GitHub repo or could be expanded upon.
   - Repointing [solution_outputs](solution_outputs) file locations <br/> Navigate to [solutions/schema.yml](solutions/schema.yml). Change links in `description:` key to point to your own git repo copy of the `solution_outputs` directory or delete this from the docs.
   - Editing [models/overview.md](models/overview.md) <br/> This markdown file can be editing to customize the landing page for the autogenerated dbt docs for your project.
- ***Adding Solutions*** <br/> 
   - Learning from reading, exploreing, and running this repo is great, but using it as a launch point to participate in the weekly challenges is even better! Hop over to [Preppin' Data's Blog Page](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) to start solving challenges your way.
