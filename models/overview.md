# Welcome to Preppin' Data in dbt!
This dbt project is works as both a working example of using dbt-duckdb to personal, local projects and well as a portfolio of solutions and documentation for using dbt to solve weekly [Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) challenges.

can be found on [my preppin-data-dbt GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jharris126/preppin-data-dbt).

# Why Use dbt & DuckDB for Preppin' Data Challenges?
### The Full ELT of a Weekly Challenge All In One Place
[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) allows for the creation of models in both [Python](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/python-models) and [SQL](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sql-models). With Python models, dbt can be used to programmatically download Preppin' Data input files and load them into this project's [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database. These input file sourcing models can be found in `models/solutions`.
### Macros and DRY Development
dbt uses [jinja + macros](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros) and allows layering smaller models in the same [DAG](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dag) to enable [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) transformation development.
### dbt Docs and Storing All Challenges In One Place
One of the biggest draw to dbt is its autogenerated docs and lineage. This benefit definitely applies to documenting Preppin' Data Challenges. dbt uses the [ref function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref) to simultaneously orchestrate `dbt run` in the proper order for managing dependencies of each building block toward the final solution as well as to generate a lineage graph of the project.

The docs and dbt's natural integration with Git facilitates a cohesive environment for storing all challenges in a single, easy to navigate project that allows for certain components and snippits to be reused across multiple weeks' challenges when applicable.
